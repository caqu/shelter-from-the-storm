Shelter from the Storm - Bob Dylan

'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood
When darkness was a virtue the road was caked with mud
I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form
"Come in", she said, "I'll give ya shelter from the storm"

I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes an' blown out on the trail
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm
"Come in", she said, "I'll give ya shelter from the storm"

Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
"Come in", she said, "I'll give ya shelter from the storm"

"Come in", she said, "I'll give ya shelter from the storm"

Now there's a wall between us, somethin' there's been lost
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began on an uneventful morn
"Come in", she said, "I'll give ya shelter from the storm"

I've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mournin' dove
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn
"Come in", she said, "I'll give ya shelter from the storm"

And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured
I'll always do my best for you, of that I give my word
In a world of steel-eyed death, and men just praying to keep warm
"Come in", she said, "I'll give ya shelter from the storm"
"Come in", she said, "I'll give ya shelter from the storm"
"Come in", she said, "I'll give ya shelter from the storm"
