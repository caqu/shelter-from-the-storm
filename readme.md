Due to The Problem of 2020, the weekly comedy show Saturday Night Live
was *Recorded From Home*, with Tom Hanks as the host and Chris Martin, 
the lead singer from Coldplay, sang "Shelter from the Storm" as part of the show. 

I wanted to track the changes in the lyrics between the original 
version by Bob Dylan and Chris Martin's in 2020, 
in order to understand how culture has changed over time.
